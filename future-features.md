## User settings
### Time to start new day
The user should be able to set the time when a day turns over into the next. Obviously, this is officially 12am, but many users will be up after 12am and still want entries logged between 12am and when they go to bed to be logged as the previous day (i.e., the concept of a day is when the user wakes up to when they go to bed, rather than a normal clock day). 
By default this should be set to 4am.
