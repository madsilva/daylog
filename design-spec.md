# Daylog

## Overview
Daylog is an app that lets you record your daily activities in an easy and natural way, by sending texts. I struggle with keeping a journaling habit, but I message people every day. I want to make an app that will let me casually send messages throughout the day of things I want to remember for that day, and the app will organize them by day for me to view later.
